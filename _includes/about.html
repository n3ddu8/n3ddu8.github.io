        <p>Hey, I'm Phil, a Data Engineer by trade, which means I spend my days wrangling data, automating pipelines, and making sure the right bits end up in the right places (most of the time). But when the workday ends, I dive headfirst into my homelab—a constantly evolving mess of Raspberry Pis, containers, and questionable architectural decisions that somehow always teach me something new. I’m the kind of person who thinks “what if I self-host everything?” is a reasonable way to spend a weekend.</p>

        <p>I’m super into open source and get a real kick out of building weird little setups just to see if I can. DevOps and Platform Engineering are my current obsessions—I love figuring out how to make things scale, stay online, and play nicely together (or at least not explode). If there’s a strange, nerdy rabbit hole to fall into, chances are I’m already ten tabs deep.</p>
