description: Welcome to the Nerd Cache — where the chaos gets context. This is where I dive into specific topics, projects, and ideas with a bit more structure and storytelling. Unlike the Brain Dump, which is more “note-to-self,” the blog is where I take a step back, zoom out, and write things up properly (well… mostly). Expect deep dives, how-tos, opinionated takes, and probably a few rants about why something should work but doesn’t.
